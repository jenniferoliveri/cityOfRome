Shopping is such a familiar part of our lives that it seldom crops up
as a topic of historical interest. However, a recent conference session
at the [Roman Archaeology Conference](http://romansocietyrac.ac.uk/) at
the [University of
Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/archaeology)
explored the nature of shopping in antiquity. It was a session of
surprises.

First up, the Romans would appear to have invented the architectural
form of a shop. There is no precedent for the shop or *taberna* within
the Greek or Hellenistic world. Thus, the Romans invented the shop that
is so familiar to us from the sites of
[Pompeii](http://www.pompeiiinpictures.org/),
[Herculaneum](http://www.herculaneum.uk/index.htm), and
[Stabiae](http://www.stabiae.org/foundation/en/). Typically, a Roman
shop had a wide opening which was closed using a grooved threshold to
[house wooden
shuttering](http://www.pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/r9/9%2007%2010.htm).

Second surprise, there is some evidence of governors building shops in
some of the more remote parts of modern Turkey. This parallels the
building of shops in Rome paid for by the state and then sold to private
individuals.

Yet, how do we consider a shift from forms of exchange associated with
the Iron Age in Britain to the purchase of goods via shops? The
transition to shopping was not just a cultural change or a shift to a
new form of economic distribution. Indeed, the development of shops in
the Roman Northwest provinces caused a total dislocation from forms of
exchange present in the earlier Iron Age.

This viewpoint causes us to take stock of when this development
happened. Detailed analysis of shops in Pompeii shows that many were not
created when much of the urban fabric of the city was built. Instead,
they are later additions dating to the late first century BC or early
first century AD. This provides a time horizon for understanding what
may be described as a "Roman retail revolution" (to quote the title of
[Steven Ellis' new
book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-roman-retail-revolution-9780198769934?cc=au&lang=en&)).

However, we need to be clear about what we wish to look at in analyzing
the possibilities of studying "shopping". Papers in the session tended
to focus on the selling of goods. This fits with [earlier
work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-0289.12055_11)
on the topic. Thus, to date, the social act of shopping remains
understudied in favour of the perspective of economic historians focused
on the seller, rather than the purchaser.

[Ray Laurence](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/ray-laurence) in
the Department of Ancient History is co-editor (with [Mary
Harlow](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/academics/harlow)
-- [University of
Leicester](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/academics/harlow))
of the first volume of *The Cultural History of Shopping* dealing with
antiquity. Interestingly, the chapters and their focus are set so that
this volume and the other five volumes, which take the cultural history
of shopping right up to the end of the twentieth century, have the same
shape -- a key feature of this [Bloomsbury series of Cultural
Histories](https://www.bloomsburyculturalhistory.com/cultural-history-series).
Thus, there will be discussions of children and shopping, gendered
shopping, the regulation of goods, and the nature of trust within the
world of retail. The end result will be a book that not only brings
shopping into the study of ancient history, but also enables the reader
to compare the character of shopping in this time period with its
development in later historical periods.
