Foundations for a triumphal arch, but which victory might it commemorate?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This week Kiri H. discusses the attempts by scholars to
interpret the meaning of the foundations of an arch excavated in the
Forum Romanum. Much remains uncertain and debate is likely to
continue!*

In 1888, German archaeologist Otto Richter discovered the foundations of
a three-bayed triumphal arch in the Roman Forum. Located between the
temples of Caesar and of Castor (fig.1), these foundations consisted of
four rectangular concrete beds topped with travertine blocks, with the
outer two bases being considerably narrower than the inner two (fig.2).
It was later recorded by Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani that the
arch corresponding to these foundations had been "found and destroyed"
by workmen in the 16th century [@Lanciani: 269].

Richter had initially identified the foundations as belonging to an arch
that was reportedly built in honour of Augustus (fig.3) after his
victory at the Battle of Actium. Cassius Dio wrote of there being two
arches dedicated to Augustus in the Forum; one in 29 B.C. for his
victory at Actium, and one in 19 B.C. for recovering Roman standards and
captives from the Parthians [(Cass. Dio 51.19.1](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/51*.html),
[54.8](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/54*.html)).
Commentary on Vergil's *Aeneid* by the Veronese Scholiast states that
the 'Parthian arch' was located beside the Temple of Caesar [@Holland: 53].
After fruitless excavations in search for the second arch,
Richter decided the foundations he had excavated between the temples of
Caesar and of Castor were those of the Parthian arch of 19 B.C..

In the 16th century, an inscription (*CIL* VI, 873) on a marble block
was discovered nearby to where Richter would later unearth the
foundations. The (now lost) inscription recorded a dedication to
Augustus in 29 BC; Platner suggested that it may have belonged to the
triple-arch but noted that its size of 2.67 metres long would have been
too small to be the principle inscription [@PlatnerAshby: 34]. Also
excavated in the 16th century were the *Fasti Consulares* and *Fasti
Triumphatores* (fig.8), fragments listing all those who had been consul,
and those who who had received a triumph, respectively [@Rose: 31].
Debate exists as to where the *Fasti* were originally located; the
Regia[^1], a building behind the Temple of Caesar, is one contender, with
another being the Arcus Augusti.

Several Roman coins are believed to depict either one or both of the
arches [@Holland: 54]. The earliest coins are *denarii* from 29-27
BC which depict a *quadriga*[^2] atop a single arch, accompanied by the
legend '*IMP CAESAR*' (fig.4). [RIC 143](http://numismatics.org/ocre/id/ric.1(2).aug.143) provides another great example of
this type (fig.5).

*\
Denarii* minted in Spain, dating from 18-17 BC, also depict a
triple-arch. The outer piers are, too, considerably narrower than the
inner piers, and support a *quadriga* flanked by figures holding Roman
standards (fig.6). The coins bear the legend '*CIVIB ET SIGN MILIT A
PART RECVP*', whilst on the reverse the head of Augustus and '*SPQR IMP
CAESARI AVG COS XI TRI POT VI*' can be seen (ANS 1957.172.1501).
Leicester Holland, an American architect, art historian and
archaeologist, argued that these legends confirm that the arch depicted
on the coins commemorates the recovery of the standards from the
Parthians by Augustus [@Holland: 54].

Further, *denarii* minted in 16 BC by L. Vinicius in Rome also bear
striking similarities. They depict the triple arch with narrow outer
piers upon which stand the *quadriga* and its flanking figures holding
Roman standards, with the inscription '*S P Q R IMP CAE*' (fig.7).
Holland argued that the coins minted in Spain and Rome undoubtedly
represent the same arch. This is as they all bear the same crowning
figures and this is the only known triple arch present during this
period [@Holland: 55].

Holland further argued that the coins minted by Vinicius present a more
accurate image of the triple-arch than the Spanish *denarii*, because
Vinicius "*would be thoroughly familiar with a monument erected in his
home city three years before*" [@Holland: 56]. On these grounds,
Holland proposed that a single arch was erected in 29 BC, and the two
wings and statues were added in 19 BC, resulting in the triple-arch
depicted by Vinicius [@Holland: 56].

However, excavations led by Gamberini Mongenet in 1950-52 resulted in
the discovery of two foundation piers spaced nearly 7m apart, located
immediately in front of the northern end of the triple-arch foundations.
These piers indicated the existence of an earlier, single-bayed arch at
this location. Mongenet's excavations also revealed that one of the
piers was supported by "*a complex system of bracing walls and
underground props built to prevent a crack from developing*" [@Gurval: 45].
These finds concluded that the single-bayed arch was indeed
the Actian arch, and that it was later demolished and replaced with the
more ornate triple-bayed Parthian arch. In 1981, Italian archaeologist
Filippo Coarelli proposed that the removal and the replacement of the
Actian arch with the Parthian was a political manoeuvre, due to the fact
that the former celebrated Augustus's victory during the civil war,
something from which, perhaps, Augustus later chose to distance himself
[@Simpson: 836].

In 1983-85, during excavations at the Temple of Castor and Pollux, the
archaeological evidence was again re-examined. Some had proposed that
the foundations were of the Parthian arch, built on top of the former
arch of 29 BC. This hypothesis was disproved by Elisabeth Nedergaard
during her investigation, which dated the structure to between 29 BC and
AD 6, meaning that, by her dating, it could not have been built over an
older structure [@RathjeLund: 51].

Professor Paul Zanker, in 1990, argued that an arch was built next to
the Temple of Caesar in honour of the "*triple triumph of Augustus*",
and bore the *fasti* [@ZankerShapiro: 203]. They argue that the *fasti*
were inscribed on marble slabs and attached to the arch, recording that
the Senate decreed a triumph for Augustus that he refused. Despite this,
the senate still erected a three-bayed arch featuring a *quadriga*
"*over Augustus's objections*" in order to recognise his achievements
[@ZankerShapiro: 187].

In 1992, C. J. Simpson reviewed the evidence surrounding the Parthian
arch in order to clarify its speculative nature. Simpson argued that
there is "*no sure numismatic or historical evidence that the so-called
Parthian arch was ever built*" and that "*we may legitimately suspect
that the arch was never built*" [@Simpson: 841]. This hypothesis
was based on several key factors. Firstly, Simpson stated that the arch
was decreed by the Senate in 19 BC, but was not necessarily erected
[@Simpson: 836]. Secondly, that there is no actual evidence of the
identity of the respective foundations discovered by Richter and
Mongenet, as those proposed were purely speculative. Additionally,
Simpson questioned Coarelli's proposal that the reasons behind the
demolishment of the Actian arch had a political agenda, that of an
attempt by Augustus to distance himself from the civil war, stating that
he, Coarelli, was "*just too imaginative*". Simpson found it "*a very
difficult concept to accept*", that the Actian arch could have been
built, yet destroyed only a decade later [@Simpson: 836].

The coins that are believed to be associated with the arch depict
Augustus in a triumphal chariot. Yet Simpson cites Cassius Dio to
provide evidence that Augustus refused to mount the chariot when
returning to Rome in 19 BC ([Cass. Dio 54.8](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/54*.html)),
stating that it is unlikely a statue of Augustus in a triumphal chariot
would have been erected when he "*would not mount one in real life*"
[@Simpson: 837]. Simpson thus concluded that the coins are not
evidence for the completion of an arch, but a portrayal of a projected
monument. In 19 BC, an altar to Fortuna (*ara Fortunae Reducis*) was
erected in honour of Augustus, mentioned by him in his [Res Gestae Divi Augusti](http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html), and also
by Cassius Dio ([54.10.3](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/54*.html)).
However, Simpson goes on to explain that: it is only in the writings of
Cassius Dio that a further arch and ovation were also used to honour
Augustus. The *Res Gestae* mentions neither of these. Simpson highlights
the inconsistencies of Dio as, despite his previous assertion, he later
states that Augustus refused all honours but the altar; once again
finding no clear evidence of the existence of the arch.

However, in 1998, Galinsky argued that both an Actium arch and a
Parthian arch existed in the Forum, the latter next to Caesar's temple
[@Galinsky: 24]. He stated that Augustus was involved "*to varying
degrees*" in these building programs and that the triple arch was
commissioned by the Senate [@Galinsky: 379].

In the same year, associate professor Robert Gurval reviewed the
arguments surrounding the is with the foundations of the single arch and
hence suggested that the removal of the arch may have been the result of
a failed attempt to save a damaged monument [@Gurval: 45]. However,
Gurval goes on to argue that "*the numismatic, literary, and
archaeological evidence is inconclusive and uncertain*", and that
historians need to move away from the notion that Augustus's victory at
Actium must have resulted in a commemorative arch [@Gurval: 46].
Gurval stated that, despite Dio's recording of an arch awarded to
Augustus after the Battle of Naulochus in 36 BC, there is no other
evidence for the existence of the Actium arch nor that of Naulochus.
Gurval suggested that it is inconsistent for scholars to believe one
arch did exist and not the other [@Gurval: 41], thus proposing that
a single arch did exist, but that it did not mention Actium and,
instead, may have celebrated the overall general achievements of
Augustus. He argued that the triple-arch did not replace the previous
arch as a notion of political change, but that it "*marked the beginning
of the imperial age*" [@Gurval: 47].

In 2005, American archaeologist Charles Rose agreed with Gurval in that
it was uncertain as to whether the arches of Actian or Naulochus existed
[@Rose: 29]. Nonetheless, he argued that the triple-arch
foundations in the Forum are, indeed, of the Parthian arch. Rose
demonstrated that this was supported by "*a wealth of evidence*", citing
associated archaeological, numismatic and literary data in proof [@Rose: 29].
He further analysed the form and fragments of the *fasti*,
noting that the decorative elements associated with the consular and
triumphal lists were more in keeping with the style of the Parthian arch
than that of the *Regia* [@Rose: 31]. Also, he highlighted that
many of the *fasti* fragments were found surrounding the arch as opposed
to the *Regia*, thus concluding that "*all of the evidence points toward
the Parthian Arch as the original site of the Fasti*" [@Rose: 32].
Additionally, the last *triumphator* listed on the *Fasti Triumphales*
was awarded a triumph in the year the Parthian arch was decreed. Rose
hence suggested that the Fasti were part of the Parthian arch, and
probably located on the walls within the passages [@Rose: 32].

The discovery of the foundations of a triple-bayed arch in the Roman
Forum in 1888 by Otto Richter sparked much intrigue and debate
surrounding the nature of the Arcus Augusti, which continues to be a
source of discussion, today. Scholars have examined and re-examined the
available archaeological, numismatic and literary evidence in an attempt
to understand if and how Augustus' triumphal arches existed. This
ongoing debate exemplifies how our understanding of the development of
the city of Rome evolves as new evidence is continually brought to
light. Yet it also encapsulates that a sizeable portion of our knowledge
concerning ancient Rome is still based largely upon interpretation and
speculation. As new technologies and techniques of research become
available, we may use them in conjunction with the critical analysis of
both modern and ancient sources to test hypotheses and examine past
research. It is through this multi-faceted approach that we strive to
create a more holistic understanding of the nature of ancient Rome.
