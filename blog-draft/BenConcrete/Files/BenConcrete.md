CEMENTING AN EMPIRE
===================

*This week Ben investigates one of the Romans' most lasting innovations
- concrete! Ben provides a solid introduction to Roman Concrete and its
significance, even today!*

A Concrete Jungle
=================

The Romans are known for many things. Murder. Assassinations. War. Salad
(Caesar - get it?). You can still see temples and other relics of the
Ancient Roman world which have withstood the tests of time. But we must
ask ourselves - why are these buildings still standing?

The answer is, arguably, one of the greatest innovations of the Roman
Empire - an innovation that the modern world stabilises itself upon,
and will continue to use as its foundations. What is this material? It
is a material of strength and durability - it can withstand enormous
pressure, hold firm against time and erosion, and underpins some of the
greatest cities in the world. It is - CONCRETE.

Concrete is a material that is not specific to the Roman Empire.
Archaeological studies point to the use of concrete or concrete-like
materials spanning decades before the Romans, appearing in India,
Asia-Minor and Greece [@GoldsworthyandMin: 934]. The difference,
however, is the durability of the Roman concrete, and its physical
properties [@Delatte: 109]. Concrete under the Roman hands would be
moulded into something new.

Roman builders followed a standardised process when producing concrete
[@Delatte: 112], a process which is largely detailed by the 1st
Century BC Roman Architect, Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. Various studies,
such as those conducted by [@Gotti], have attempted to follow the
procedure set down by Vitruvius. What was found was that Vitruvius
[Vitr.
2.5.1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D1);
[5.12.2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D12%3Asection%3D2)
developed an "academic ideal" for concreting - a recipe which, when
perfected, would create long-standing concrete structures.

Of course, this process was not perfect from the beginning. It developed
and improved over the course of the Roman Empire - the biggest divide
being between the Republican and Imperial stages of the Empire itself.
This divide is evident in the structures hailing from each period -
namely in their construction, innovation, symbolism, and general
structure. Yet their differences are weak, compared to their
similarities - concrete has always had many CONCRETE uses.

The Foundations of Concrete
===========================

The history of concrete in Rome is traced through its use in the various
epochs of Roman history. A basic recipe is developed quite early on -
slaked limestone is mixed with sand and water to develop a "high-quality
plaster" [@GoldsworthyandMin: 934]. To add strength, Romans would
utilise various aggregates designed to provide extra stability within
the mortar. During the Republic, these aggregates would be seemingly
random - often tuff fragments, rubble from buildings and glass. These
aggregates would reflect the "near-site geographical setting" and were
generally haphazard [@Marra: 191].

Early Roman concrete structures reflect this method - the Porticus
Aemilia (*fig. 1*), used as a warehouse and built in 193 BC, is the
earliest known example of Roman concrete use [@Marra: 183-185]. These
warehouses showcase an earlier version of Roman concrete - the mortar
is mixed with "scrap material" as a base, with "volcaniclastic material"
providing an adhesive [@Marra: 190]. At this time, the system of
building using concrete is basic - the Romans want to build things, and
don't appear to care for how. This has largely to do with restrictive
timeframes; due to the one year term of official positions.

In 111 BC, the Romans struck gold - or concrete [@Marra: 194].
Mortar is mixed with Pozzolana - volcanic ash deposits (*fig. 2*) first
found at the town of Pozzuoli, north of Naples [@Delatte: 109]. This
ash, when combined with lime, sand, and water, gains a cementitious
value [@GoldsworthyandMin: 935]. This is because the ash undergoes a
chemical reaction when mixed with the water, causing it to harden
[@Jackson: 1669]. This addition would allow Republican leaders to
develop larger feats of concrete-based infrastructure, as well as
gaining the ability to be used in marine construction [Vitr.
2.6.1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D1).
This is an important development in the use of concrete, resulting in
its active use hereafter.

Consider, for example, the Capitoline Hill. The Capitoline Hill itself
is twin-peaked - a north and south summit, connected by an underlying
substructure, the *Tabularium* [@Davies: 89] (*fig. 3*). A large
concrete slab, complete with arches and vertical walls, bridged the gap
between the summits to expand the ground for Roman infrastructure
[@Davies: 89]. This is an amazing feat, considering it was built
around 78 BC! The *Tabularium* still sits on this saddle and supports
the *Piazza del Campidoglio* in modern Rome. Concrete thus not only
ensured the longevity of the Roman world, but expanded it.

'A Concrete Revolution'
=======================

Under Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD), we see a Golden Age of concrete.
Political stability and a standardised process meant that Augustus and
subsequent Emperors could build bigger and more permanent structures
without worrying about shorter timeframes. During the Imperial Ages,
older structures are restored using concrete bases, the process becomes
streamlined [@Delatte: 112], and newer structures are designed with
greater effects. Concrete wasn't just a foundational base anymore - it
was used in walls, domes, sea walls, and other areas. It became a symbol
of progression and stability - a testament to time.

A case in point would be the Pantheon - a structure where concrete was
more than just a base (*fig. 4*). The Pantheon was first built during
the reign of Augustus by his friend Agrippa and was restored twice after
that - the first time around 80 AD by Domitian, and then again by
Hadrian in 126 AD [@Coarelli: 286]. The central focus of the building
- the 43.4 metre concrete dome [@Delatte: 109] - is largely
attributed to Hadrian's restoration. The dome itself is a fantastic
example of the versatility of Roman concrete - not only is it
structurally sound, but the patterns and designs built into it reflect a
durability otherwise unseen.

Set in Stone (or Concrete)
==========================

Concrete gave the Empire more than just stronger structures, however.
Concrete represents a multitude of things - stability, strength,
durability, longevity - all of which reflect a strong government or
presence in society [@Dumser: 137]. This advertisement of power and
authority had its origins in the Republic. Buildings were commissioned
by private individuals to selfishly strengthen their image through
public dedications [@Dumser: 136]. This sentiment is true for
concrete materials during the Republic as, since political stability was
fleeting, patrons had to leave a lasting image of their presence to keep
favour.

This sentiment is best reflected in the competition of infrastructure
between Pompey and Caesar during the Republican years [@Davies: 97].
During these years "architecture and politics were inextricably
intertwined" - to ensure longevity, leaders needed "rapid concrete
construction" to solidify their position [@Davies: 99]. Pompey and
Caesar would continuously battle for control in the Roman Republic
(49-48 BC) - however, their battles were fought not just on the
battlefield.

Both men were focused on gaining visibility by manipulating the public
space of the City of Rome to match their desires. Since concrete
"imposed symbolic and physical authority", whichever man had more
concrete structures, the more concrete their political position
[@Davies: 84]. Pompey's Theatre (*fig. 5*), for example, was a large
complex built by Pompey in 55 BC to impose his presence on the city
landscape with a concrete core. The theatrical complex included a
theatre, gardens, a temple, a *portico*, and a *curia*. The theatre
itself could accommodate for up to 20,000 people [@Temelini: 42].
Semi-circular in shape, the beautiful structure was a concrete example
of Pompey's presence in the city, and of the symbolic use of the
material during this period. For more information on the Theatre of
Pompey, see Ewan's blog.

As mentioned previously, this symbolic value of concrete was not lost on
Augustus or later Emperors either. Due to Augustus' long time in power,
and his persistence in ensuring stability, concrete development and use
could be standardised through a stricter recipe and concentration of the
process. This standardisation of building materials and techniques, and
planning procedures, made building projects more systematic [@Delatte:
112]. They began to use scaffolds to provide a stronger structural
outline [@Delatte: 113], which allowed them to design new structures
to boost their image - e.g. the Pantheon's Dome. Through Vitruvius, we
see that this recipe was so important it was written down for future use
to ensure the longevity of the practice.


Concrete was even employed in the building of the *Portus* at Ostia by
Emperor Claudius, started in 42 AD, as a way to both provide a safe and
nearby harbour for Rome, and to cement his legitimacy and rule
[@HohlfelderandBrandon: 55]. The *Portus* proved an excellent place
to utilise the enhanced strengthening of concrete by seawater, which is
still resistant to seawater today [@Jackson: 1669]. The *Portus* was
finished by Nero (*fig. 6a*) in 64 AD and is commemorated in his coinage
(*fig. 6b*). It was later expanded by the addition of a hexagonal
harbour by Trajan, finished in 112 AD [@HohlfelderandBrandon: 57],
which still retains its shape, owing to its concrete construction.

Additionally, using concrete was the signpost of a smart leader.
Concrete production and building boosted the economy, it was cheap,
the aggregates could come from recycled rubble (as used by Nero after
the 64 AD fire), and only required simple workmanship, boosting
employment [@White: 86]. Concrete meant jobs, which meant a stronger
economy, a larger labour force, and a smart leader who only wanted the
best for their City. Rome never looked better than when its people saw
another concrete structure go up.

Shine bright like some concrete...
==================================

The student of Ancient History is, no doubt, obsessed with the 'cool'
topics -- war, murder, political strife, etc. Yet, we never consider the
nitty-gritty parts of Rome -- what housed the Generals when they
discussed these wars? When Caesar was assassinated, what material lay
beneath his body? And when Rome eventually fell, what rubble coated its
streets, and what stayed standing? The Romans use of concrete is nothing
but exceptional -- not only was it regularly used throughout the
Republican and Imperial periods of Rome (until around the 3rd century
AD) [@GoldsworthyandMin: 934], its value was more than structural. A
concrete building meant a concrete leader -- both would stay long after
the people were gone.

Augustus, it is said by Suetonius [Suet. Aug.
28.3](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#28),
left Rome a city of marble when he died. With all due respect, the
truth of this statement is not clear enough. Augustus may have left a
city built of marble, but the Roman legacy itself was built with
concrete.

provides further detail into buildings mentioned here, as well as other
buildings made of concrete

Vitruvius' [*De
Architectura*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0073)
talks about a variety of building-related concepts of the Romans, as
well as the theory behind concrete production.

Corporals Corner has produced a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOhAfaFboNU) on the actual
process of creating "Roman" concrete, using more modern materials.
Although he does follow the methods as set out by Vitruvius, it is
important to note that Romans may not have even created concrete using
the same methods and materials used in the video.
