 abstract = {The commonly accepted reconstruction of the architectural form of the Theater of Pompey and Temple of Venus Victrix with the temple raised on an arcaded base of several stories rests on inadequate evidence. Examination of our sources and the Severan Marble Plan indicates that behind the theater there was probably a tree-lined avenue leading to Pompey's house and that the temple was a modest shrine, like other theater-temples.},

 abstract = {The scaenae frons of the Theater of Pompey as shown on the Marble Plan of Rome is often thought to belong to the Severan period. This article argues that the Marble Plan shows the scaenae frons as rebuilt after the fire of A. D. 80. Its novel design directly influenced the builders of the Trajanic/Hadrianic theaters of Taormina and Benevento. At the same time a simplified version of the scaenae frons of the Theater of Pompey became fashionable and was widely diffused throughout the Roman Empire during the second century A. D. The author's discovery that the architect of the theater at Taormina used illusionistic column effects closely similar to those used in the South Theater at Gerasa adds substance to recent speculation about Eastern influence on its design.},

 abstract = {Maintained throughout the Roman empire, the Theater of Pompey had fallen into ruins by the early 12th century. By 1762 its remains had been identified, and in 1835 the architect Luigi Canina produced a graphic reconstruction revised by Victoire Baltard in 1837. An 1865 excavation recovered a colossal bronze Hercules and new sections of the theater, but no further studies followed. In 1996-2001 Richard Beacham and James Packer documented the accessible remains, studied the earlier reconstructions, and assembled a catalogue of all references to archaeological finds. Their research led to a small excavation in the ambulacrum that partially cleared modern rubble and recovered ceramic and marble fragments. Foundation trenches for elevators in the southeast court of the palace revealed a deposit of 12th- to 15th-century pottery, part of a vault from a radial corridor in the theater, and a frescoed wall fragment. The new documentation and excavation plans also provide important new information on the Pio Palace and the Temple of Venus Victrix. This article provides a more accurate picture of the architecture, appearance, and situation of the theater and related buildings than previously available and offers considerable promise for subsequent excavations.},

abstract = {On September 29, 55 BC, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, master of Italy, and conqueror of Spain, Africa, and the East, celebrated the grand opening of his magnificent building complex in the Campus Martius. This extraordinary monument was an architectural achievement hitherto never attempted at Rome. The building complex was designed with Rome's first permanent stone theatre, a temple of Venus Victa quadriporticus, a curia, and housed numerous works of art. Pompey was a triumphant imperator, who used his manubiae to build a monumentum that would best represent his desire for supreme and everlasting glory, in an age of political turmoil, social upheaval, and religious strife. The attempt to discover what influenced Pompey to build such a structure and the purposes it served will show that the building complex functions as an architectural metaphor toward Pompey's quest for popularity at Rome.},

@article{Russell,
abstract = {This dissertation uses a combination of literary and archeological evidence to ask how Romans understood and defined public space in Rome during the Republic. The definition of concepts of `public' and `private' in Roman culture differed from that current in modern Western discourse, but just like modern definitions, it was ambiguous and manipulable. Taking public space as a starting-point offers new insights into the Roman concepts, and a behavioural approach, aided by insights from space syntax theory, allows for a partial reconstruction of the diversity of spatial experience in the city. Traditionally, lack of behavioural control has been associated with private space, but for the majority of the population, who were not householders, it was public spaces which were characterised by greater freedom of access and behaviour. Public space was not a monolith, but offered a variety of spatial experiences and was experienced differently by different groups. Moreover, just as the space of the Roman elite house was more `public' than we might naively suspect, public space in the city of Rome was determined by and thoroughly saturated by the private. The Republican Forum Romanum incorporated domestic and commercial space as well as political space, which itself was never neutrally `public' but always contested. The grand victory porticoes of the Campus Martius mark out sacred space but also space associated with an individual general, and their architecture and decoration increasingly mark them as semi-private, until eventually Pompey's theatre-portico complex incorporates not only a curia but also his own house. We see attempts to exploit the ambiguities of existing discourses of public and private, creating spaces like victory complexes and basilicas. Although Latin uses publicus and privatus as a natural and exclusive pair, the terms were in fact contested even in ancient times, and very little space in Rome was entirely public or entirely private.},
