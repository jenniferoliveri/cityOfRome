The Curious Tourist's Guide to Rome: Trajan's Market
====================================================

*This week Zoe explores the "World's First Shopping Mall", the Markets
of Trajan. Through her examination of archaeological and written
evidence, Zoe draws parallels to our modern world. Are our shopping
habits similar to those of the Romans? Find out this week!*

Welcome to the *Mercati di Traiano!*
====================================

Located at the north-western end of the Via dei Fori Imperiali, nestled
against the Quirinal Hill (*fig. 1*), stands the Markets of Trajan, a
'must-see' when visiting Rome. Just a short walk from Piazza Venezia and
the Roman Forum, Trajan's Market is an extraordinary example of imperial
Roman architecture. Designed by Apollodorus of Damascus and commissioned
by Emperor Trajan, the complex was built between 100-112AD and
accompanied the impressive Forum of Trajan [@Lancaster1: 63].

The World's First Shopping Mall
===============================

Often referred to as the world's first shopping centre, the Markets of
Trajan consists of 150 rooms across a six-story complex [@Lancaster2:
285]. However, evidence suggests that Trajan's Market was more than
just a mall, but rather a commercial complex, housing *tabernae*, [^1]
administrative offices and residential apartment blocks [@DAquino:
84]. [@VreelandandVreeland: 33] suggest that the market was
organised as follows:

-   Level 1: Main entrance hall for the distribution of grain, with
    other commodities like oils, fruits and vegetables sold across the
    levels

-   Level 3: Terrace and taverns accessed by the *Via Biberatica*
    (*fig. 2*) [^2]

-   Level 4: Home to exotic spices and pepper

-   Level 5: Administrative offices of Public Assistance

-   Level 6: Ponds and fish connected to an aqueduct

This system gives us an idea of how the marketplace would have
functioned, serving both commercial and civic purposes. Ancient writers
([Mart.
5.59](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book09.htm))
also describe typical Roman shops, which consisted of wide entrances,
small displays out the front and a larger selection of goods inside
[@BroekaertandZuiderhoek: 322]. Much like our own modern
supermarkets, this demonstrates the evolution of the marketplace and may
explain how we have come to use our shopping malls today.

Dating Trajan's Market
======================

Trajan's Market was the name given to this multi-story complex during
the excavations of the 1920's and 30's [@Lancaster1: 25-26]. It has
been assumed that the market was an extension of Trajan's Forum, echoing
the semi-circular shape seen in the *exedra* [^3] of the forum (*fig.
3*). Although no ancient writers directly refer to the market, they do
describe Trajan's forum. Such references can be viewed in conjunction
with archaeological evidence like brick stamps (small impressions on the
surface of a brick, often containing a builder or person's trademark) to
help us gain a greater understanding of the historical context of the
building.

Written Evidence
================

Ancient evidence for the dating of Trajan's Market is quite ambiguous.
On one hand, we have the Roman poet Martial ([Mart.
7.61](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book07.htm))
and Roman historian Aurelius Victor ([Aur. Vict. *Caes*.
13.5](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#13.5)), who
suggest that Emperor Domitian, a predecessor of Trajan, was responsible
for the planning and initial construction of the forum. On the other
hand we have the Greek geographer Pausanias ([Paus.
5.12.6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D12%3Asection%3D6))
and Roman statesmen Cassius Dio ([Cass. Dio
68.16.3](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#16.3);
[69.4.1](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#4))
who attribute the entire construction to Trajan (*fig. 4*).

Brick Stamps
============

The dating of Trajan's Market is better represented through
archaeological evidence. Across the complex you can find brick stamps,
which contain symbols and words that offer information about the context
of the building. The presence of Domitianic (used during the time of
Emperor Domitian) stamps within the complex has caused modern historians
to question who built the markets. It has been suggested that the use of
Domitianic bricks in the construction of the markets was because of
Domitian's untimely death, which resulted in a stockpile of left over
bricks [@Lancaster1: 25-26].

The brick stamp of T. Camudenus Atimetus further assist us with the
dating of the markets. Located at the base of the complex, the stamp, as
well as other stamps bearing his name, call Atimetus the assistant of
Trajan's wife, Empress Plotina [@Lancaster1: 30-32]. This indicates
that Trajan did in fact commission the market, as the location of the
stamp at the base of the building and references to Atimetus and Plotina
place the complex firmly in the Trajanic period.

Roman Innovation
================

Trajan's Market is one of the best surviving brickfaced monuments from
Imperial Rome. The markets are an excellent example of Roman building
innovation, using advanced techniques like bonding and concrete
vaulting. By looking at how and where these techniques were used, we can
gain a greater understanding of how Roman builders and architects
managed to construct such large building complexes.

Bonding
=======

Bonding was a technique used by the Romans to level, stabilize and even
decorate walls with brickwork, through specific organisation and
placement of bricks. One of the earliest examples of this technique can
be found at the Colosseum. Bonding courses of *bipedalis* [^4] at
Trajan's Market appear alongside construction features like vaults,
arches, windows and floor levels [@Lancaster2: 283-285]. The use of
bonding in such places suggests that this method was used to increase
the strength and stability of the complex. *Bipedalis* courses that are
bonded also appear yellow in colour and are often thicker than the
average brick-faced wall, making them stand out. A fine example of this
can be seen found on the ground floor of the hemicycle, where you can
clearly see where the yellow pattern of courses meets the travertine
arches [@Lancaster2: 287] (*fig. 5*).

the hemicycle. Photo by Ray Laurence"

Concrete Vaulting
=================

The magnificent *Aula* [^5] located on level 4 of the market,
demonstrates the success of Roman concrete vaulting. The magnificent
two-story hall consists of six groin vaults (the x-shaped intersection
of two archways) supported by 14 travertine piers (*fig. 6*), which are
further flanked by *tabernae* on either side [@Lancaster3: 772]. The
use of groin vaulting appears in the *Aula* more than anywhere else in the
Markets, adding to the significance of the space. Apollodorus
revolutionized groin vaulting by swapping solid walls for travertine
supports, which maximised the natural light and spaciousness of the
complex [@Ressler]. The *Aula* reflects the technical ingenuity of the
Roman people and offers us a unique look into the visual culture of
imperial Rome.

Who's the Boss?
===============

When it comes to building complex structures like Trajan's Market,
questions arise about how the Romans managed to plan, organize and
execute their elaborate constructions. This leads us to the subject of
architects and builders, particularly the role of construction teams and
the effectiveness of building laws.

Architect v. Builder
====================

The relationship between architect and builder is an indicator of the
success of imperial building programs. Although we do not know exactly
who or how the jobs were assigned, Roman author and architect, Vitruvius
offers us some clues. Vitruvius designed and supervised his own projects
([Vitr.
5.1.6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D6)),
however he suggests that in some cases, architects would take the advice
of workers ([Vitr.
6.8.10](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D10))
Whilst this implies that architects were typically the supervisors of a
site, it also shows flexibility within the Roman workforce and positive
exchanges between builders and architects. In terms of building safety,
it was the responsibility of the *redemptor* [^6] or the client, not the
architect, to make sure a structure was stable [@Lancaster3: 764].
The *probatio* [^7] of Trajan's Market would have been critical a
position, as he must be certain that all levels and elements (stairs,
vaults, walls) were safe and secure for the public [@Lancaster3:
765].

Laws
====

By looking at legal documents, we are able to see how the administration
process assisted the development of buildings like Trajan's Markets.
According to ancient sources, building codes regulated the construction
of both public and private structures ([Frontin. *Aq*.
2.119](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html#2.119)).
The Digest of Justinian, a compendium of writings about Roman law under
the Emperor Justinian I, describes the roles of Roman *redemptors*,
demonstrating the importance of planning and regulation for buildings in
Rome ([*Dig*.
50.8.2.11](https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D50_Scott.htm#VIII);
[50.10.2.1](https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D50_Scott.htm#X)).
The contracts -
[*stipulatio*](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Obligationes.html)
and [*locatio*
*conductio*](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Locatio.html)
were most common during this time, with the former
referring to an oral agreement and the latter, a more
detailed arrangement, which outlined skill, labour and cost. Without
these laws, Romans would not have been able to co-ordinate and construct
grand-scale projects like, Trajan's Markets.

height="502" %}

Construction Teams
==================

Both written and archaeological evidence indicates that groups of
different builders constructed Trajan's Market. According to ancient
writers ([Stat. *Silv*.
4.3.40-53](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/StatiusSilvaeBkIV.php#anchor_Toc317239405);
[Vitr.
7.1.3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D3);
[7.3.10](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0073%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D10)),
builders generally worked in small groups called *decuria*
[@BroekaertandZuiderhoek: 328]. Trajan's Market would have required
several building teams in order to tackle such a grand space.
Fluctuations between the heights of *bipedalis* courses along the
hemicycle facade indicate that more than one building team constructed
Trajan's Market. If you look closely at the hemicycle walls, you can
find disruptions in the brick bond patterns, suggesting that masons
would have worked side by side, regularly bringing the walls back into
alignment. Today, masons call these discrepancies 'pigs,' an interesting
name for an adjusted brick piece [@Lancaster2: 291].

Are We Romans?
==============

We can find many similarities between ancient Romans and ourselves. From
our love of shops, to our strict building codes, it is clear that many
of our modern ideas have come from ancient concepts. Trajan's Market
offers the best of imperial architecture, providing us with some of the
greatest examples of Roman innovation and design. By examining building
techniques along with written evidence, we gain a greater appreciation
of Trajan's Market, as we see how Roman architects overcame the
difficulties faced in building a multi-story complex into the side of a
hill.

So what do you say?

Come and visit Trajan's Market today!
