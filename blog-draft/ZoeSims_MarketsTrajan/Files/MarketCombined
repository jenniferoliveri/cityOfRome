<p><em>This week Zoe explores the “World’s First Shopping Mall”, the Markets of Trajan. Through her examination of archaeological and written evidence, Zoe draws parallels to our modern world. Are our shopping habits similar to those of the Romans? Find out this week!</em></p>
<h1 id="welcome-to-the-mercati-di-traiano">Welcome to the <em>Mercati di Traiano!</em></h1>
<p>Located at the north-western end of the Via dei Fori Imperiali, nestled against the Quirinal Hill (<em>fig. 1</em>), stands the Markets of Trajan, a ‘must-see’ when visiting Rome. Just a short walk from Piazza Venezia and the Roman Forum, Trajan’s Market is an extraordinary example of imperial Roman architecture. Designed by Apollodorus of Damascus and commissioned by Emperor Trajan, the complex was built between 100-112AD and accompanied the impressive Forum of Trajan <span class="citation" data-cites="Lancaster1">(Lancaster <a href="#ref-Lancaster1">1995</a>: 63)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="the-worlds-first-shopping-mall">The World’s First Shopping Mall</h1>
<p>Often referred to as the world’s first shopping centre, the Markets of Trajan consists of 150 rooms across a six-story complex <span class="citation" data-cites="Lancaster2">(Lancaster <a href="#ref-Lancaster2">1998</a>: 285)</span>. However, evidence suggests that Trajan’s Market was more than just a mall, but rather a commercial complex, housing <em>tabernae</em>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> administrative offices and residential apartment blocks <span class="citation" data-cites="DAquino">(d’Aquino <a href="#ref-DAquino">2015</a>: 84)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="VreelandandVreeland">(Vreeland and Vreeland <a href="#ref-VreelandandVreeland">2006</a>: 33)</span> suggest that the market was organised as follows:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Level 1: Main entrance hall for the distribution of grain, with other commodities like oils, fruits and vegetables sold across the levels</p></li>
<li><p>Level 3: Terrace and taverns accessed by the <em>Via Biberatica</em> (<em>fig. 2</em>)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Level 4: Home to exotic spices and pepper</p></li>
<li><p>Level 5: Administrative offices of Public Assistance</p></li>
<li><p>Level 6: Ponds and fish connected to an aqueduct</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This system gives us an idea of how the marketplace would have functioned, serving both commercial and civic purposes. Ancient writers (<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book09.htm">Mart. 5.59</a>) also describe typical Roman shops, which consisted of wide entrances, small displays out the front and a larger selection of goods inside <span class="citation" data-cites="BroekaertandZuiderhoek">(Broekaert and Zuiderhoek <a href="#ref-BroekaertandZuiderhoek">2013</a>: 322)</span>. Much like our own modern supermarkets, this demonstrates the evolution of the marketplace and may explain how we have come to use our shopping malls today.</p>

<h1 id="dating-trajans-market">Dating Trajan’s Market</h1>
<p>Trajan’s Market was the name given to this multi-story complex during the excavations of the 1920’s and 30’s <span class="citation" data-cites="Lancaster1">(Lancaster <a href="#ref-Lancaster1">1995</a>: 25-26)</span>. It has been assumed that the market was an extension of Trajan’s Forum, echoing the semi-circular shape seen in the <em>exedra</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the forum (<em>fig. 3</em>). Although no ancient writers directly refer to the market, they do describe Trajan’s forum. Such references can be viewed in conjunction with archaeological evidence like brick stamps (small impressions on the surface of a brick, often containing a builder or person’s trademark) to help us gain a greater understanding of the historical context of the building.</p>

<h1 id="written-evidence">Written Evidence</h1>
<p>Ancient evidence for the dating of Trajan’s Market is quite ambiguous. On one hand, we have the Roman poet Martial (<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book07.htm">Mart. 7.61</a>) and Roman historian Aurelius Victor (<a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html#13.5">Aur. Vict. <em>Caes</em>. 13.5</a>), who suggest that Emperor Domitian, a predecessor of Trajan, was responsible for the planning and initial construction of the forum. On the other hand we have the Greek geographer Pausanias (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D12%3Asection%3D6">Paus. 5.12.6</a>) and Roman statesmen Cassius Dio (<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html#16.3">Cass. Dio 68.16.3</a>; <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#4">69.4.1</a>) who attribute the entire construction to Trajan (<em>fig. 4</em>).</p>
