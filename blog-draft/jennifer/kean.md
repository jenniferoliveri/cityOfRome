Modern Rome is far from ranking among the world's most populated or
diverse cities. Its ancient predecessor, however, was home to a masses
of people from throughout the vast Roman empire. In the late
Republic---shortly before the 'golden age' of Augustus---Rome
experienced a massive population boom, reaching a million inhabitants
and becoming the largest city in the Western world until 19^th^-century
London (Cascio, 2018: 139). Expansion on this scale can only have
occurred through inward migration.

Migrant identities
==================

From its earliest days, Rome was a city of migrants. Of its mythical
forefathers, Aeneas was a Trojan refugee and Romulus populated his new
city with asylum seekers ([Livy
1.8.5-6;](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+1+8&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0166)
[Plut. *Rom.*
9.3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Rom.+9+3&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0014);
[Holleran, 2011:
160](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/lib/mqu/reader.action?docID=807342&ppg=167)).
Throughout Rome's early history, most migrants came from other parts of
Italy. Between 203 and 187 BC, a multitude of Latins had moved to Rome,
causing their ambassadors to complain that they didn't have the men to
provide soldiers for the Roman army ([Livy
41.8.6-7](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+41+8&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0151)).
Despite 12,000 Latins eventually returning home, the city was still
'burdened' by large numbers of Italians ([Livy
39.3.4-6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+39+3&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0149)).

By the end of the Republic, migrants from outside Italy were also
present. In the first century BC, Sallust described Rome as a 'cesspool'
of unfavourable people ([Sall. *Cat.*
37.5](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html)).
Regardless, as Rome's power expanded, wealth flowed into the city,
followed by more and more people from throughout the vast empire
(Morley,2013: 43). By the first century AD, Rome was described as
'thronged with no citizens of her own, but filled with the dregs of the
world' ([Luc. *Pharsalia*
7.405](https://archive.org/details/pharsaliaoflucan00lucaiala/page/270)).
Others took a more positive view of Rome's multiculturalism---Athenaeus
called Rome the 'epitome of the civilised world', where those from many
great cities had flocked and 'entire nations' had settled ([Ath.
1.20b-c](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Athenaeus/1B*.html)).
This mix of attitudes towards the multicultural identity of a city is
familiar to us.

Push and pull
=============

Like today, people in the ancient world had a wide range of reasons for
migrating. For the early migrants from the Italian countryside, social
and economic circumstances acted as 'push' factors (Morley, 2013: 43).
However, 'pull' factors, such as the growing wealth of Rome in the
second century BC and the rising prices for urban products, were likely
more significant (Holleran, 2011: 160). The introduction of the corn
dole in 123 BC was a draw, as was the opportunity to secure a wealthy
patron ([Sall. *Cat.*
37.7](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html)).
The number of recent and temporary migrants taking advantage of the dole
caused Caesar to restrict the benefits to permanent residents, halving
the number of recipients ([Seut. *Iul.*
41.3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Jul.+41&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132)).
Augustus closed the list of recipients in 2 BC ([Cass. Dio.
55.10.1](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html)),
restricting it to a privileged and hereditary group of the population
([SHA *Aurel.*
35.1](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/2*.html)).

Many foreigners came to Rome as slaves and soldiers, who became a
significant presence and shaped the fabric of the city. It has been
estimated that there were between 100,000 and 300,000 slaves in Rome
during the early empire. Because of Rome's high rates of manumission,
ex-slaves grew the free population and more slaves had to continually be
brought in (de Ligt, 2013: 8). Estimates regarding the proportion of the
population made up by slaves vary greatly, but average to approximately
10%, while freedmen likely made up 5-7% (Hermann -- Otto, 2013: 73.
Soldiers made up perhaps 10-30% of the population in the first three
centuries AD. Most were migrants and many from outside of Italy. The
Praetorian Guard was the most significant military force in Rome, with
soldiers serving 16-17 years and being billeted just outside of Rome at
the Praetorian camp (**Figure 1**) ([Noy, 2000:
20](https://www.academia.edu/1338255/Immigrants_in_Late_Imperial_Rome)).

This walled camp stood on one of the highest points of the city and
dominated both the view from the city, and its eastern and north-eastern
roads ([Platner, 1929:106]
(http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0054)).
The camps significance is demonstrated by its appearance on coins of
Claudius, who was proclaimed emperor by the Praetorian Guard after their
assassination of his predecessor (**Figure 2**).

Many migrants came to Rome for its economic, political and even
cultural opportunities. Seneca names many motivations, such as ambition,
public office, ambassadorship, luxury, liberal studies, shows,
friendship, industry, and the sale of their beauty or eloquence
([Sen. *Helv.*
6.2-3](https://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-de_consolatione_ad_helviam/1932/pb_LCL254.431.xml?rskey=viFDzE&result=2)).
As Rome expanded its dominance, it benefitted from the spoils of war,
taxation, and the exploitation of the empire's resources. It was a
centre of production and trade by both land and sea, providing
opportunities for merchants and skilled craftsmen. For the less skilled,
huge amounts of labour were needed to provide necessities for the
growing population, and luxuries for the wealthy (Cornell, 2014: 134).
One piece of remaining evidence for foreign merchants in Rome is the
*stationes.* These buildings were associated with traders and shipowners
from specific areas---most in Rome belong to migrants from eastern
Mediterranean cities and bear inscriptions in Greek ([Noy, 2000:
160](https://www.academia.edu/1338255/Immigrants_in_Late_Imperial_Rome)).
Wealthier migrants had a more tangible impact on the city by building
grand houses, dedicating monuments or buildings, or setting up
impressive funerary inscriptions.

Supply and demand
=================

The range of pursuits which brought the wealthy to Rome were supported
by the acceleration of the city's building program from the first
century BC (Claridge, 2018: 114). The first permanent theatre was opened
in 55 BC, the first amphitheatre in 30 BC, and the first of Rome's great
bathing complexes in 25 BC (Cornell, 2014: 160). Under Caesar and
Augustus, an ambitious building program included a new forum, voting
house and senate house ([Pearson, 2018:
569](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118300664.ch28)).
These new facilities provided entertainment and greater legal and
political opportunities which both attracted and were a response to the
growing population.

In the same way, infrastructure was a draw for migrants, who then
created further demand for it. Water was a constant need for the growing
city, and it was achieved by the construction of an impressive system of
aqueducts by which 'veritable rivers flow(ed) through the city' ([Strabo
5.3.8](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5C*.html)).
Rome's first aqueduct was built in 312 BC, followed by several new and
improved examples to increase the water supply, which was multiplied by
fifteen in a 400-year period (**Figure 3**) ([Brunn, 2013:
297](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-ancient-rome/water-supply-drainage-and-watermills/3DC976D43F8991719A59F6D51ED0462D);
Dodge, 2014: 452).

image="kean/Figure3.jpg"
width="418"
height="335" %}

Rome's water capacity has been reasonably estimated
as 520,000-635,000 m^3^ per day---an impressive figure even for a modern
city ([Brunn. 2013:
306](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-ancient-rome/water-supply-drainage-and-watermills/3DC976D43F8991719A59F6D51ED0462D)).
It was equally essential to upgrade Rome's port facilities in order to
provide sufficient food, as Rome was heavily dependent on imported
resources. These new facilities, built along the Tiber in the second
century BC, included huge, multiple-storey warehouses with thick walls
(Erdkamp, 2013: 274; Mattingly and Aldrete, 2014: 386). Many food
storage facilities were concentrated south of the Aventine hill,
creating a district known as the Emporium (Mattingly and
Aldrete, 2014: 386).

Rome, the Metropolis
====================

Particularly in the late Republic, the construction of infrastructure
facilities are associated with periods of population growth. While these
improvements were certainly a 'pull' factor for migrants, the arrival of
migrants also contributed to the greater need for the basic necessities
which first attracted them. As a result, the increasingly large and
diverse population physically impacted the city in many ways.

For instance, higher population density created a greater demand for low
to middle-class housing. This was met by the construction of multistorey
apartment blocks (**Figure 4**).

{% include lightbox.html

image="kean/Figure5.jpg"
width="418"
height="335" %}

Literary and archaeological evidence suggest that the majority of Rome's population was housed in such
buildings, and that certain areas were almost exclusively dedicated to
*insulae* ([De Laine, 2018:
319](https://www.wiley.com/en-au/A+Companion+to+the+City+of+Rome-p-9781405198196)).
Rome was undoubtedly overcrowded, and its population density has been
likened to modern Bombay or Calcutta (Storey, 1997: 976). The risks of
such overcrowding are made explicit in texts regarding the dangers of
fire or collapse, and by the regulation of building heights from
Augustus' time onwards ([Gell. NA
15.1.1-3](https://www-loebclassics-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/view/gellius-attic_nights/1927/pb_LCL212.59.xml);
[Juv. Sat.
3.7-8](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/JuvenalSatires3.php#anchor_Toc281039202);
[3.193-196](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/JuvenalSatires3.php#anchor_Toc281039207);
[Sen. Controv.
5.5](https://www-loebclassics-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/view/seneca_elder-controversiae/1974/pb_LCL463.487.xml?result=1&rskey=deD9P6);
[De Laine, 2018:
318](https://www.wiley.com/en-au/A+Companion+to+the+City+of+Rome-p-9781405198196)).
The need for high-density housing created a physical division of the
city---Rome's low ground was packed with *insulae* crowded around public
spaces, while the upper slopes were more thinly inhabited by wealthy
town houses (Claridge, 2018: 116).

Construction methods also changed during the second century BC as Rome
became more dependent on mass labour forces, consisting largely of
slaves and other migrants. It was efficient to employ more standardised
techniques and regular components, which could be used by unskilled
workers. One example is the technique of *opus reticulatum*, which
created a diamond pattern (**Figure 5**).

image="kean/Figure6.jpg"
width="418"
height="335" %}

Concrete, which was lighter and simpler to construct than stone, also became more widely used
(Cornell, 2014: 146; Claridge, 2018: 114). Changes such as these quickly
transformed the metropolis.

Rome, the melting pot
=====================

The presence of a wide range of nationalities in Rome also shaped the
physical fabric of the city. In some quarters of Rome there is evidence
of a higher population of foreigners. At Trastavere, for example, there
is a high number of oriental cult shrines near Asian and Syrian burials,
that give evidence for the neighbourhood\'s multicultural residents.
Trastavere was located outside the *pomerium,* a religious boundary
within the city, and so was open to the establishment of foreign cults
([Noy, 2000:
160](https://www.academia.edu/1338255/Immigrants_in_Late_Imperial_Rome)).
Foreigners are also often identified by their funerary inscriptions, but
there is little evidence of migrant groups establishing their own
separate cemeteries, with the exception of Jews ([Noy, 2000:
160](https://www.academia.edu/1338255/Immigrants_in_Late_Imperial_Rome)).

Rome's multiculturalism is also expressed through its religious
buildings. There were several temples and shrines to the Egyptian
deities Isis and Serapis throughout Rome, most notably the monumental
temple complex on the Campus Martius (**Figure 6**).

{% include lightbox.html

image="kean/Fig7below70dpi.jpg"
width="418"

These do not necessarily attest to the presence of Egyptian migrants, as the cult was
popular throughout the ancient world ([Noy, 2000:
160](https://www.academia.edu/1338255/Immigrants_in_Late_Imperial_Rome)).
They are, however, a good example of how Roman attitudes to foreign
groups were expressed in the city. At times the Egyptian deities were
popular and cult centres were established or restored by Roman
authorities ([Cass. Dio.
47.15.4](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html#temple_of_Serapis_and_Isis));
[Eutrop.
7.23.5](https://archive.org/details/eutropiusabridge00eutr/page/n41);
[SHA *Alex.*
26.8](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Severus_Alexander/1*.html#26.8)),
while at other times the cults were supressed ([Cass. Dio.
53.2.4](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#2.4);
[54.6.6](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6.6);
[Tac. *Ann.*
2.85](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/2C*.html#85);
[Suet. *Tib.*
36](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#36);
[Joseph. *Ant.*
18.3.4](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-18.html#S3.4)) and
their shrines destroyed ([Cass. Dio.
42.26.2](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/42*.html#26.2)).
There is inscriptional evidence of migrants dedicating monuments to
foreign gods in Rome. A bilingual inscription in Latin and Aramaic, by a
Palmyrene freedman and Roman citizen, states that he and fellow
Palmyrenes dedicated an altar to their god Malakbel (**Fig. 7**) ([Noy,
2000:
160](https://www.academia.edu/1338255/Immigrants_in_Late_Imperial_Rome)).
This demonstrates that distinct foreign groups lived in and made a
tangible impact on Rome.

Conclusion
==========

As Rome's empire spread throughout the ancient world, its epicentre
began to reflect its massive size and scope. On one hand, the wealth and
opportunities represented by Rome's increasingly impressive
infrastructure and facilities, were a strong pull for migrants. On the
other, the influx of migrants forced the city to adapt to meet the needs
of an unprecedently huge population. The number and diversity of the
people in Rome was a result of migration and had a huge impact on the
fabric of the city.
